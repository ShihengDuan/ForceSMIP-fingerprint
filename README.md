Pattern-based fingerprint analysis using ForceSMIP dataset at monthly timesteps. Work at LLNL.    

 
* ```eof-pr.ipynb```: EOF and PC just for precipitation.  
* ```eofs_all_annual.py```: solving EOFs for annual timesteps; ForceSMIP.  
* ```eofs_cmip5_annual.py```: solving EOFs for annual timesteps; CMIP5. 
To be noted: PCs are not normalized in ```eofs*.py```. Normalization and flips are done in ```obs/```. 



obs:
